# Pokémon Tabs - Gotta' Read Them All!

## Description: 
This application renders information in the form of tabs, a common UI pattern.

The tabs display information on four different Pokémon when clicked.  The information is pulled from the PokéAPI.

Each time the user clicks a tab, the website pulls data from the PokéAPI, specifically at the respecitve URL for each Pokémon when the user clicks its tab. The data pulled from the API includes the following for each Pokémon:

* front image
* back image
* primary abilities
* primary moves

Click each tab at the top to learn more about Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Charmander, and Beedrill!

## Technologies Used:
* Front End: HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript

## Challenges:
Understanding the structur of and accessing data from the PokéAPI was my main challenege as this was my first time working with APIs.  Reading the documentation of the API helped. But, once I understood the PokéAPI was structured like a JSON object, with key-value pairs, I could access the data I needed. 

## Additional Resources:
Access the PokéAPI with the following URL:
[https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/]

The PokéAPI is consumption-only, meaning only the HTTP-GET request is available for the data in the API.

At the end of the URL insert a number or name of Pokémon to access a specific Pokémon. 

## Future Iterations:
* Add functionality to where a user can access information on all the Pokémon in the Pokêmon API.
