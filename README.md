# Project-3-UI-Pattern

##Pokémon Tabs = Gotta' Read Them All!

This UI pattern displays four tabs that, when clicked, show information about four different Pokémon. Kind of like a Pokédex!

Each time a tab is clicked, the website pulls data from the PokéAPI. The data pulled from the API includes the following for each Pokémon:

- front image
- back image
- primary abilities
- primary moves

Click each tab at the top to learn more about Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Charmander, and Beedrill!
